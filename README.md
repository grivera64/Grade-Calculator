# Grade-Calculator
This is my class project about finding the weighted grade for my CSC121 class. This program was meant to serve as my replacement to manually inputting my grades to determine my GPA.

## Functionality
I used Java's java.util and java.io classes to build this project. The Grade Calculator asks for an input file directory from the user in the following format:

sample.txt
--------------------
Full Name
ID Number
Course Name
Grade Credits
...
Course Name
Grade Credits
EOF
-------------------

In then outputs the user's GPA in the console.

## How to Setup
To setup and run the code, you need to download the repo, and compile and run using a Java Compiler through the command line.

Ex:
> cd Desktop         //go to directory

> javac Main.java    //compile file

> java Main          //run file

And then you are set!
