# Grade-Calculator
This is my class project about finding the weighted grade for my CSC121 class. This program was meant to serve as my replacement to manually inputting my grades to determine my GPA.

## Functionality
I used Java's java.util and java.io classes to build this project. The Grade Calculator prototype asks for some input from the user in the console.

In then outputs the user's grade.

## How to Setup
To setup and run the code, you need to download the repo, and compile and run using a Java Compiler through the command line.

Ex:
> cd Desktop                     //go to directory

> javac GradeCalculator.java    //compile file

> java GradeCalculator          //run file

And then you are set!
